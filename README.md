# Mini 3D-Printed Ion Thruster

## Overview
A prototype ion thruster was designed in SolidWorks and 3D-printed using a Bambu Lab A1 printer, generating an ionic wind of 5 m/s for low-power propulsion studies. Mirrors NASA’s electric propulsion for small satellites and other research.

## Features
- **Components**: Air inlet, crown/ring electrodes (coated in aluminum foil-tape), nozzle, 400kV transformer, 4-AA battery pack.
- **Outputs**: Ionic wind velocity, which was validated through propulsion tests.
- **Methodology**: This ion thruster testing used systems engineering for the electrode design and high-voltage integration. The 3D-printed parts were hot-glued together, the wires of the battery were soldered to the transformer, and the transformer to the motor, where both electrodes were covered in aluminum foil tape.

## Results
Achieved 5 m/s ionic wind with optimized electrode spacing (15mm)—stable performance at 400kV, with potential for electroplating upgrades.
